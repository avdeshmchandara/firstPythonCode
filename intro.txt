Practicing by writing programs, is undoubtedly the best way to learn a programming language. And its almost a convention to start 
with ‘Hello World’ program, which simply prints “Hello World” to the screen. Python is a powerful tool, so a ‘Hello World’ would 
take just one line of code, so we start with something not as trivial. Following is our choice of first program. This has been 
designed to be simple yet it contains almost all the components of how a well structured code should look like. This program 
establishes a primary driving function called ‘main’, which inturn calls two other functions namely the ‘first_function‘ and the 
‘second_function‘.

We will assume that the reader is already fimiliar with a bit of python, and understands the importance of correly indenting the 
code.
